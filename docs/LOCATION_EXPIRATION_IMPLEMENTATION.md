# Location Expiration Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic location expiration feature that allows locations (especially public ones) to be automatically deleted after a specified time period.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Added expires_at column definition
- `supabase/migrations/20241012000001_add_expires_at.sql` - Migration script

#### Changes:
- Added `expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` column to locations table
- Created index `idx_locations_expires_at` for performance
- Created trigger `trigger_set_location_expiration` to auto-set expiration
- Created function `set_location_expiration()` with logic:
  - Public locations: automatically set to 24 hours from creation
  - Changing to public: sets 24-hour expiration
  - Changing from public: clears expiration

### 2. Backend API Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `app/api/locations/route.ts` - Location creation endpoint
- `app/api/cleanup/expired-locations/route.ts` - Cleanup endpoint

#### Changes:
- **POST /api/locations**: Now accepts `url` and `expires_at` fields
- **POST /api/cleanup/expired-locations**: Uses `expires_at` instead of `created_at`
- **GET /api/cleanup/expired-locations**: Enhanced status reporting

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Updated Files:
- `components/mapscomponents/location-dialog.tsx`
- `components/LocationEditDialog.tsx`
- `app/(routes)/profile/page.tsx`
- `components/mapscomponents/map-container.tsx`

#### LocationDialog Changes:
- Added expiration option selector (24h, custom, never)
- Added custom hours input
- Added privacy warnings based on selection
- Visual indicators for expiration settings

#### LocationEditDialog Changes:
- Added same expiration options as LocationDialog
- Pre-populates current expiration settings
- Calculates remaining time for existing locations

#### Profile Page Changes:
- Displays countdown badges (e.g., "12h 30m left")
- Shows full expiration timestamp
- Updated `updateLocation` to handle `expires_at`
- Color-coded badges for visibility

#### Map Container Changes:
- Added comment about database trigger handling expiration
- Ready for future manual expiration control

### 4. Documentation

#### New Files:
- `docs/location-expiration.md` - Comprehensive feature documentation
- `docs/SETUP_LOCATION_EXPIRATION.md` - Step-by-step setup guide

#### Content:
- Feature overview and rationale
- API documentation
- Database schema details
- Deployment instructions
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

### 5. Configuration

#### Existing File:
- `vercel.json` - Already configured with cron job

#### Configuration:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cleanup/expired-locations",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Expiration Flow

1. **User creates public location**
   - Database trigger automatically sets `expires_at` to 24 hours from now
   - User can override with custom duration or "never expire"

2. **Hourly cleanup job runs**
   - Vercel Cron calls `/api/cleanup/expired-locations`
   - API queries for locations where `expires_at < NOW()`
   - Deletes expired locations
   - Returns count of deleted locations

3. **User views locations**
   - Profile page shows countdown timer
   - Visual badges indicate time remaining
   - Full timestamp available in details

### User Experience

#### Creating Locations
1. User creates a public location
2. System shows expiration options:
   - **24 hours** (Recommended) - Default for privacy
   - **Custom** - 1-720 hours (30 days)
   - **Never** - Persistent location
3. Privacy warning explains implications
4. Location saved with appropriate `expires_at` value

#### Managing Locations
1. User views locations on profile page
2. Countdown badge shows time remaining
3. Edit button allows changing expiration
4. System prevents accidental permanent public locations

## Security & Privacy

### Benefits
- ✅ Public locations auto-delete after 24 hours by default
- ✅ Reduces long-term location data exposure
- ✅ Encourages temporary location sharing
- ✅ User control over expiration settings
- ✅ Clear warnings about privacy implications

### Safeguards
- Clear visual indicators of expiration status
- Privacy warnings for "never expire" option
- Secure cron endpoint (requires CRON_SECRET)
- Database trigger ensures consistency

## Required Environment Variables

```env
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
```

Generate secure secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Set CRON_SECRET environment variable
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (cron auto-enabled)
- [ ] Test location creation with expiration
- [ ] Test cleanup API endpoint
- [ ] Verify cron job in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Monitor first few automatic cleanups

## Testing

### Manual Tests
1. **Create expired location**:
   - Create public location
   - Manually set `expires_at` to past in database
   - Run cleanup API
   - Verify deletion

2. **Test countdown display**:
   - Create public location with 2-hour expiration
   - Check profile page shows countdown
   - Refresh page, verify countdown updates

3. **Test expiration options**:
   - Try all three options (24h, custom, never)
   - Verify correct `expires_at` values in database
   - Check privacy warnings display correctly

### API Tests
```bash
# Check status
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cleanup/expired-locations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Run cleanup
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cleanup/expired-locations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Index on expires_at**: Ensures fast queries for cleanup job
- **Partial index**: Only indexes rows with expiration set (WHERE expires_at IS NOT NULL)
- **Hourly cleanup**: Balances timeliness with system load
- **Batch deletion**: Deletes all expired in single query

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Email notifications before expiration
2. One-click extend expiration
3. User preference for default expiration
4. Analytics dashboard
5. Archive instead of delete
6. Grace period before deletion
7. Bulk expiration management

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users
- Existing locations unaffected (expires_at = NULL)
- Public locations won't expire unless edited
- Optional: Run update query to expire all current public locations

### Breaking Changes
- None - fully backward compatible
- Old API calls work (expires_at optional)
- Database handles defaults

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Check Vercel Cron dashboard weekly
- Monitor cleanup API logs
- Track deletion counts

### Maintenance
- Review expiration patterns monthly
- Adjust cron schedule if needed
- Update default expiration based on feedback

### Troubleshooting
See `docs/SETUP_LOCATION_EXPIRATION.md` for:
- Common issues
- Rollback procedures
- Debug commands

## Conclusion

The location expiration feature is now fully implemented with:
- ✅ Automatic database-level expiration handling
- ✅ Hourly automated cleanup
- ✅ User-friendly UI with clear controls
- ✅ Privacy-focused defaults
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

Users can now safely share public locations knowing they'll automatically expire after 24 hours (or their chosen duration), significantly improving privacy and security.
